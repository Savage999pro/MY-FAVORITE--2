        <h3>Fishing is one of the greatest hobbies practiced religiously since ancient times. Some call it a sport while others consider it the art of life. Though this began as a means of survival for many, it has now turned into the most favorite activity to do to kill your festering boredom. Fishing is good for the environment, it uses selective fishing methods, adapting to the marine environment and thus avoiding accidental catches. Minimizes energy, chemical and waste production in all your operations. It maintains biodiversity. Ensures true traceability from the capture point to the market. People fish because it teaches us about nature, even while showing us how much we don't know. And fishing becomes the foundation for our fondest memories. In Why We Fish, Robert Montgomery examines the reasons we keep going back to the water and how fishing enriches us, both individually and as a society. Humorous and fascinating stories by ten experienced fishermen (and women) answer that question. We hook fish; they hook us. It’s that simple. Yet, the subject is deeper than it appears. Nationally recognized fishing writer Robert U. Montgomery began pondering this about 20 years ago, when he realized how fishing helped him survive the death of his best friends. Robert discovered that we fish to remember, and we fish to forget. We fish when we’re happy, and when we’re sad. We fish to bond with friends and family, or to be alone. Whatever our motivation, no matter where we are on the success spectrum, fishing makes our lives better in ways we never could have imagined. It slows us down. It sets us free. It teaches us about nature, even while showing us how much we don’t know. And fishing becomes the foundation for our fondest memories. In Why We Fish, Robert Montgomery examines the reasons we keep going back to the water and how fishing enriches us, both individually and as a society. Contributed by ten passionate anglers, the essays on these pages celebrate the tangible and intangible blessings we derive from one of man’s oldest pastimes. What is life all about? Go fishing and find out. But first, enjoy the wonderful essays in Why We Fish. .As you probably already know, fishing can be an expensive hobby. Basic needs for fishing include rods, reels, boats, motors, trolling motors, life preservers, etc, etc. Even a modest fishing enthusiast can spend $2500 or more on these basic start-up materials.</h3>

He is a Professorial Fellow of Computer Science at the University of Oxford[2] and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[3][4] Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989,[5][6] then implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November.
        <br>
Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which oversees the continued development of the Web. He is also the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation and is a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founders chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[12] He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI)[13] and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.[14][15] In 2011, he was named as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation.[16] He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute and is currently an advisor at social network MeWe.[17]
<br>
In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.[18][19]

In 2007, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for being principally responsible for inventing the World Wide Web. He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped foster the Web's subsequent explosive development. He currently directs the W3 Consortium, developing tools and standards to further the Web's potential. In April 2009, he was elected a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.[20][21]
<br>
He was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a number of other accolades for his invention.[22] He was honoured as the "Inventor of the World Wide Web" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in which he appeared working with a vintage NeXT Computer at the London Olympic Stadium.[23] He tweeted "This is for everyone"[24] which appeared in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the audience.[23] He received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale". </p>
